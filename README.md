# eddrit

An alternative frontend for Reddit, written with Python + [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/). Inspired by [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter), an alternative frontend for Twitter

- Lightweight
- No ads
- Compact design (closer to [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com) than to the redesign)
- Mobile support (responsive design)
- Use the old `.json` APIs, no need for OAuth2 identifier
